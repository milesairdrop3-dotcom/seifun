## Test Execution

### 1. Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
make test-smart-contracts
make test-backend
make test-integration

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run tests
        run: make test-all
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### 3. Performance Testing
```bash
# Run performance tests
make test-performance

# Run load tests
make test-load

# Run stress tests
make test-stress
```

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Test Review Process
- **Code Review**: All tests must be reviewed
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage requirements
- **Performance Validation**: Latency and throughput checks
- **Security Validation**: Security test requirements

### 2. Test Maintenance
